# Adventure-Game-framework
This is a framework for creating and playing text adventure games. The player moves a character on a playing field and can perform different actions on the fields. A game consists of an initial state that describes how a set of objects are distributed over the game field. Mutation rules specify how objects can be transformed by the player into other objects.
